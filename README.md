# Description:
This game, Tetris, is an exercise in the manipulation of simple graphics, arrays, and input listeners.The game starts out at a slow pace, but then as the user gets a tetris (or passes twenty lines cleared) the speed increases to make the game more challenging. It features three songs for the user to listen to while playing. The game ends when a piece cannot be generated on the board.

# Instructions:

THIS APPLET MUST BE RUN USING FROM A COMMAND LINE OR TERMINAL USING THE FOLLOWING COMMAND: appletviewer Tetris.html


THE PROGRAM WILL NOT FUNCTION IN A NORMAL BROWSER DUE TO COMPATIBILITY ISSUES!!!!

A class that controls the drawing of the game board.

InfoPanel.java:
A class that controls the drawing of the information panel in the game.

# Parts Implemented:
All but that which is included in Parts Not Implemented.

# Parts Not Implemented:
A high-score system was not implemented due to time constraints (exams, papers, etc.)

# Known Bugs:
There are no known bugs, with the exception of the applet not working in a browser and when the game ends and tries to terminate the applet, a stacktrace will be printed because Windows doesn't allow it to close the appletviewer. This is not a problem with the code, but simply a permissions issue.
